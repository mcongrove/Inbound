About
-----

Inbound displays, in an abstract manner, the frequency Earth is bombarded by coronal mass ejections emanating from the Sun. Minimalist and modern, the display mounts to any wall to remind and inform people that solar activity has a constant and tangible impact on our planet.

The project is a submission for the [International Space Apps Challenge](http://spaceappschallenge.com) by [Jon Alter](https://github.com/jalter), [Rick Blalock](https://github.com/rblalock) and [Matthew Congrove](https://github.com/mcongrove).

Components
----------

Inbound's LEDs are controlled through an Arduino that connects to a custom web service via an ethernet shield. The web service parses data from SIDC's [CACTus tool](http://www.sidc.oma.be/cactus/), which utilizes information from the STEREO and LASCO satellites.
